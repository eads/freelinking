If you are using the CVS version of freelinking.module version 1.9 or
lower, you will need to reapply the freelinking.mysql script to your
database. Please read this file carefully.

What version of freelinking.module do I have?
==================================================
The version of the module is given in the CVS "Id" tag. Look at the
beginning of the file (you can use the 'head' command in Unix to see the
first few lines) For a line that looks like this:

   $Id$

This tells you that you are using version 1.9 of freelinking.module,
committed at 1:19 on 15 may 2005, by eafarris.

Upgrading version 1.9 or earlier to the current CVS version
==================================================
As the new version of freelinking.module requires a database schema
change, you'll need to modify your database to work with the new
version. To do this, simply reapply the freelinking.mysql script as you
did when you installed the module:

$ mysql -u drupaluser -pdrupalpass drupaldb < freelinking.mysql

NOTE: This will DROP your existing freelinking table, DELETING its
contents. This was an unfortunate but necessary step. But do not worry,
the table will be repopulated quickly! On every page view, the content's
freelinks are checked in the table and added if necessary.

IT WILL ALSO DROP the cache table, so the freelinking table gets
repopulated as quickly as possible. This is a safe operation, but your
Drupal site may experience some slowdowns as the cache table itself gets
rebuilt.
