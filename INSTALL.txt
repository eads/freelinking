# freelinking.module Installation Instructions

1. Copy the freelinking/ directory into your Drupal installation's
   modules/ directory.

2. Install the database schema into your Drupal database, with a command
   like (but probably not identical to):
   mysql -u drupaldbuser -pdrupaldbpasswd drupaldb < freelinking.mysql
      
3. Enable the freelinking module in admin/modules.

4. (optional) Set configuration options how you want them in
   admin/settings/freelinking

5. Enable the freelinking filter in one of your input formats in
   admin/filters. This filter should play well with other filters, but
   it might need to be last in the chain so that links aren't
   overwritten.
