# CHANGELOG.txt for freelinking.module

version 1.4
---
* applied a modified version of a patch by Wes Cowley
  (http://drupal.org/node/21433) that implements a syntax similar to
  4.5's title.module. Thanks, Wes! That should fix the feature noted
  above.  This does (slightly) break the freelinking page, since links
  can be to outside URLs, and can also be to a different target than the
  source text. I'm working on this.

* you can optionally turn off CamelCase. This is also part of Wes's
  patch.

* implemented filter tips. That should fix http://drupal.org/node/21434

version 1.3
---
* implemented a database table that keeps a record of freelinking
  phrases. When freelinking_page() is called without an argument
  (http://drupalsite.com/freelinking/) a list of freelinking phrases are
  given, along with their status, either "create this content" or a link
  to the content. This could be used to encourage users to create
  content that is a target of a link, but doesn't yet exist.

version 1.2
---
initial public release.

Evolved from ninjafishwiki.module, and dwiki.module before that. 
removed wiki nodetype. This is more appropriately handled by flexinode,
or by reusing a core node type like blog or story.
