# CHANGELOG.txt for freelinking.module

version ????
---
development version.

* implemented a database table that keeps a record of freelinking
  phrases. When freelinking_page() is called without an argument
  (http://drupalsite.com/freelinking/) a list of freelinking phrases are
  given, along with their status, either "create this content" or a link
  to the content. This could be used to encourage users to create
  content that is a target of a link, but doesn't yet exist.

version 1.2
---
initial public release.

Evolved from ninjafishwiki.module, and dwiki.module before that. 
removed wiki nodetype. This is more appropriately handled by flexinode,
or by reusing a core node type like blog or story.
